# MergeOS Professional

Our goal is to bring back the nostalgia of Windows XP with the functionality of Modern Windows.

Our project is heavily based on ReactOS and Wine-hq. While we try to improve their code as much as we can, MergeOS Professional is still not at all ready for production due to the limitations of creating a Windows Compatible OS without containing any Microsoft Source Code.
