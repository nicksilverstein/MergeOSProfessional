This is VFAT driver release 0.0.5

To install :
	extract files
	delete all object files (*.o) in all subdirectories
         (because include file include/ddk/iotypes.h is modified and is used by many files)
	recompile mergeos

What's new :
 - some bugfixes
 - support for IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL
    (see mergeos/tst/sshell.c for use of ZwQueryDirectoryFile)
